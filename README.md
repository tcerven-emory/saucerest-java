A Java client for Sauce Labsâ€™s REST API. This supercedes the old [sauce-rest-api].

WARNING: must export GPG_TTY=$(tty) for gpg error when doing mvn install.

Using this client you can update Job info, including pass/fail status and other information supported.  Only the Sauce Labs Virtual Device Cloud is supported.  For Real Devices, please see [the docs](https://api.testobject.com/).

If a function you're after isn't supported, we suggest either shelling out and using the curl version, _or_ sending a pull request!  [Contribution Details Here](https://github.com/saucelabs/saucerest-java/blob/master/contributing.md)

# Usage
## Create an instance of the client
```java
SauceREST sauce = new SauceREST("username", "access-key");
```
OR
```java
SauceREST sauce = new SauceREST("username", "access-key", Datacenter.US);
```

Users generally only have access to their own jobs and resources.  Parent accounts may have access to their children's jobs.  Check out the Sauce Labs documentation for more information.

## Change a job's metadata
###Mark a job passed or failed:
```java
sauce.jobPassed(job_id);
sauce.jobFailed(job_id);
```

## Get all tunnels

```java
String tunnels = sauce.getTunnels();
```

## Download Assets
Assets are downloaded by providing a job ID and the location to save the asset too.

### Selenium log

```java
sauce.downloadLog("job_id", "/var/tmp/selenium.log");
```

### HAR File
HAR files are only available for jobs using [Extended Debugging](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70072943).

```java
sauce.downloadHAR("job_id", "/var/tmp/HAR.log");
```

### Video
Video is only available for jobs which have not [disabled video recording](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Test+Configuration+Options#TestConfigurationOptions-Disablevideorecording).

## Get Information
### About a particular job
```java
sauce.getJobInfo("job_id");
```

### About the last 20 jobs
```java
sauce.getJobInfo();
```

### About a requested number of jobs
```java
sauce.getJobInfo(n);  #n is the number of jobs to retrieve, as an integer
```

### About your tunnels
```java
String tunnels = sauce.getTunnels();
```
